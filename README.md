DRONE RACING: THE BIG RACE

The Drone Racing Application allows a user to login, create, and tune a 2018 AAI RQ-7A BLACK HAWK drone based on the specifications of speed, acceleration, turning, weight, drag, durability, and handling.  Once the user is satisfied with the tuning of their drone they are able to race against another users drone that is in the database.  Based on the specifications of the users drone compared to the random one selected in the database the user is given an outcome message of ‘YOU WON’ or ‘YOU LOST’.  

Additional features that are The record of win losses are tracked for each race that the user participates in.  Also with every won race the user gains points toward a driver level and a drone level as well as winning price money.  The money that the user wins will eventually be able to be used to add points to their point balance and can be redeemed.  The point balance is what is used to increase the specifications of the drone, speed, acceleration, turning ect.  So the more the user races the more wins they will accumulate, and the more money they will earn allowing them to buy points and increase the specs on the drone allowing a better chance to win races.
